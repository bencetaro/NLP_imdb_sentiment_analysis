# Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews
I made this notebook on Kaggle to try out an NLP model.
It turned out to be not so bad, but improvements are still could be done (model structure,parameters,preprocessing).
I received 90% accuracy on training data (86% on validation), and 21.5k/25k correct classification on test data.
